# Flash Cards App

A simple flash card application built with React to help you learn about state management and component-based architecture. This app displays pre-defined flashcards that users can flip to reveal answers, track their progress with a dynamic progress bar, and navigate using simple "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

## Features

- **Pre-defined Flashcards:**  
  Test your knowledge with a set of pre-loaded questions and answers.

- **Card Flip Animation:**  
  Click on a flashcard to flip it and view the answer using smooth CSS transitions.

- **Dynamic Progress Bar:**  
  The progress bar starts at 0% and fills up as you navigate through the cards, giving you a visual indication of your progress.

- **Navigation Controls:**  
  Easily move through the flashcards with "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

- **Custom Favicon:**  
  The project includes a custom inline SVG favicon that represents a flash card (with the initials "FC").

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Core language for building interactive features.
- **React:** A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces using component-based architecture.
